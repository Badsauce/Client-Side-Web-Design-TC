I like the style of a bright gradient graph set against a dark background, it really makes the infromation pop. Additionally the minimalism highlights the information.

Again, minimalist graphs are awesome. The use of semicircles to display data is also slick, the concentric circle display is especially slick.

I really like the flat textures and the bright colors set of against the dark background. The usage of circles in place of tradidtional percentacge bars gives a futuristic look to the design... In general circles seem to equal futuristic design...
